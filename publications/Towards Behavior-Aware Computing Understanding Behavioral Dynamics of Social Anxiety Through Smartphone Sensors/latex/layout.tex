\begin{abstract}
The way people use smartphones provides a window into the relationship between behaviors and mental health. This relationship is of particular significance to individuals with elevated social anxiety, as it helps to reveal when and where their stress increases in relation to social interactions, ultimately leading to more precise treatment delivery and interventions.  In this collaboration between engineers and psychologists, we present the first study to use smartphone sensors to examine socially anxious individuals' fine-grained behaviors around periods in which they engage in some form of social interaction, and how this might be different as a function of location (e.g., at home, at work, or at an unfamiliar location). To characterize behavior, we use smartphone accelerometer data before, during, and after phone calls and text messages as well as the semantic location at the time of communication. In a two-week study with 52 college students, we show that there is a significant difference in behaviors for individuals based on social anxiety levels and locations, in that individuals higher (vs. lower) in social anxiety symptoms exhibit more movement (as tracked by the accelerometer) around the time of phone calls, especially in an unfamiliar location (i.e., not home or at work). Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for developing better interventions for socially anxious individuals.

% I think here it's more "In this paper, we present the first study to passively monitor accelerometer data (or however we end up wanting to describe "behavior") to understand socially anxious individuals' fine movement patterns around periods where they engage in some form of social interactions (as indicated by their use of calls or texts), and how this might be different as a function of location (e.g., at home, at work, or at an unfamiliar location).

% I think this feels really vague and too broad, because behavior could mean a variety of things. But I'm struggling to define what behavior in this case means--is "motion and movement patterns extracted by the accelerometer (that can indicate fidgeting, pacing etc)" in the right ballpark?

%Understanding behavioral dynamics of mobile phone use is fundamental for facilitating better treatment and intervention for mental health problems such as social anxiety since scholars in psychology have noted that cell phone use is influencing human health and behavior, specifically for the college students who are the most rapid adopters of cell phone technology. However, the relationship between physiological and psychological dimensions of behavioral dynamics of cell phone use has not understood well. Researchers mostly explore models of smartphone usage patterns from subject measures (i.e. surveys) or application usage data without consideration of behavior dynamics with the further goal of facilitating interventions for human health. In this work, we explore these characteristics of behavior dynamics of cell phone use and show their performance in discriminating groups with different social anxiety levels. We analyzed two weeks of behavior data, including accelerometer, GPS, and contacts (call and text), from 64 cell phone users using our unsupervised feature learning approach. Our results have profound implications on the relationships between cell phone use and social anxiety level and determination of when and where the intervention should be delivered.
