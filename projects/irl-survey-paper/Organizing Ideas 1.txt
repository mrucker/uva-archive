Learning from Demonstration (LfD)   -- An area of research primarily concerned with robots learning from human demonstrations how to carry out motor skills
Apprenticeshp Learning              -- An area of research that formalizes tasks as MDP's and then tries to learn a reward function that induces behavior similar to observed behavior
