    Introduction
        We design for when the driver needs to understand something about the vehicle and take the correct action
        
    Why Automate?
        Alleviating Congestion
            Vehicles only use about 5% of road way (consider width of lane combined with forward/backward distance between vehicles)
            Reduce stop and go disturbances
        Reduce energy & Emissions
            Close-formation platoons
            Reduce accelerate/decelerate cycles
        Improve Safety
            94% of US crashes caused by driver
    
    Three levels of Driver/Vehicle Control
        Operational -- turning car on, signalling, cruise control
        Tactical    -- navigating intersections
        Strategic   -- defensive driving, speed on road, path selection
        
    Current Workflow
        Planning -> User Needs -> Concept Development -> Prototype Development -> Validation
        Do we need a new workflow for autonomous vehicle creation and design
    
    What mental models do we need to create and support human functioning in a driving system?
    
    How to handle authority transitions from human driver to autonomous driver? Research seems to suggest it takes humans 40 seconds to fully mentally engage in driving.
        How can we handle the pass off so that human can take some control immediately with assistance until 40 seconds switch.
        
    Lots of coordinated information on shown on distributed displays. Is there a coordination hub or do they all work independently?
    
    Next level of autonomous driving is developing system understanding of the human state rather than just understanding environment/road state
        What are the critical driver states that need to be identified for each HMI phase?
