User Interface 
    Haptic
        Direct precise manipulation
        Mental model well-defined (you push a button, you turn a knob, you slide a slider)
        Blind operation possible (don't have to take eyes off road)
        Haptic feedback
        Always the same configuration (modeless)
        Quickest operation tie
        Combination w/ new technologies
        Low cost
    
    Rotary Knob
        Indirect manipulation (changes something else like radio volume)
        Blind operation possible
        Haptic feedback
        Ergonomically better than touch for scrolling
        Differences in scroll directions between OEMS (mental model less well-defined)
        
    
    Touch Screen
        Direct manipulation
        Less haptic feedback
        Blind operation difficult
        Different modes, buttons are not always in the same place
    
    Speech
        Good for complex tasks, questions
        Bad for simple tasks like turning the volume up (takes too long)
        
    Gestures
        No killer use case for gestures
        Direct feedback difficult since no clear interface (speech has language, everything else has physical touch, does the car gesture back???)
        
    Eyetracking
        Attention and fatigue detection
        Measure cognitive load through pupil diameter

HMI Ergonomics
    Colors
        Color and contrast establish the visual hierarchy (what is most important?)
        Color and brightness contrast for better distinctness (colorblindness)
        Spatial depth established by brightness (dark colors are "in the back" bright colors "in the front")
        Cultural differences and color semantics need to be taken into account
        The larger the area, the less saturation
        Blue light leads to poorer readability at night (short wavelengths leads to flickering at night)
    
    Fonts
        Humanistic fonts (e.g. Frutiger) have up to 16% better readability than geometric constructed fonts (e.g. Eurostile)
        Minimum font sizes (according to law) between 3.5 mm and 4.5 mm (36% better readability from 3.5 - 4.5)
        Positive contrast more readable, less fatigue (e.g., black font on white background)
    
    Touchareas
        Touch operation while driving requires a high level of attention
        >=20 mm^2 touch areas recommended
        
    Driver Distraction
        AAM/NHTSA guidelines for driver distractions must be fulfilled
        Max 2 seconds time (colloquially called a chunk) for one operation (not looking at the street)
        Display instruments should be over a viewing angle of 30 degress
        Animations, transitions and moving visualizations forbidden

Autonomous Driving
    Levels of Automation
        Level 0 manual driving
        Level 1 assisted driving 
        Level 2 partial automation (Tesla)
        Level 3 conditional automation - Predefined takeover time (e.g., driver should be ready to step in after a 10 second warning time)
        Level 4 high automation - Predefined use cases (e.g., driving on auto-bahn)
        Level 5 full automation
        Irony of automation -- moving from one level to another causes reduction in driving skill. That is, each level requires unique skills to be successful.
    
    Handover Times & Mode Confusion
        Multimodal feedback important
        
    Driver Distraction vs. Driver Attention
        Creating interfaces that require constant glancing increase driver readiness to take over driving
        
    Trusted Interactions
        Building trust through traceability, predictability and reliability
        Current studies show an acceptance of autonomous vehicles (Lvl 3) after 30-60 minutes
        Multimodal interactions build trust (viewed as a social actor)
        How can you regain trust after losing it? (e.g., Accident)
        Social dialogue between car and passenger is important ("Why did the car drive through the pothole? - again." How can I interact with the car about this)
        
Trends
    Exterior Design
        All-electric powertrains will change the shape of cars
        Shared economy - Pool Cars
    
    Interior Design
        Driving will no longer be the main task
        The car as a living space next to home and office
        Shared economy - Pool Cars
        Safety is a big limitation on interior design (e.g., glass looks nice and feels good but is bad in a crash)
        
    Sensors
        Interior surveillance (is the driver sleeping, what is the safest way to crash given passenger orientation, etc.)
        Monitor the vital signs of passengers
        Identifcation and personalization (shared car)
        Determine mental condition and stress levels (workload management)
        
    Speech Assistant
        holy grail for in car interaction
        central intelligent agent across all life modes (manage home temperature and as well as work appointments)
    
    Responsive Design
        Modern car can have up to 6 screens all various sizes and resolutions.
        Touchpoints for car system on outside of vehicles
    
    3D Displays
        Two displays on top of eachother. The back one maybe 2 or 3 inches off the front.
        
    Augmented Reality Head Up Display (AR HUD)
        Must be very bright to contrast natural daylight
        
    Personalization
    
    Mobile Touchpoints
        Vehicle is just another component of the digital ecosystem
        Seamless transition of the brand/user experience when enterig or leaving car
        Access vehicle services outside of the car
