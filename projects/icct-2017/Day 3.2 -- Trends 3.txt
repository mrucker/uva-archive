    Introduction
        By focusing on a domain we can simplify problems (e.g., industrial robot doesn't care about emotions. Digital assistant doesn't care about 3D space)
        ISO 15066 defines collaorative robot specification and expectations
            Defines Collaborative Workspace -- an operating space where the robot system (including the workpiece) and a human can perform tasks concurrently
            Defines exact pressures and length of time for all kinds of contact between humans and robots (Ann. A)
    
    Why/When/How HRC in Industrial Manufacturing
        Neither full automation nor purely manual work optimzes the overall process
        Fit robot actions to the human workers as they work individually
            big tall lefties as well as slim small righties
            
    Privacy
        Using cameras, not a good idea
        Using 3d depth sensors, ok
        
    Variations
        Individual Variation (nominal, tolerate)
            human position, trajectory, size, handedness, ...
        "Spontaneous" Variation (non-nonimnal, tolerate)
            sneeze, wave to colleagues, ...
        Critical Variation (non-nominal, raise exception)
            sequencing error, blockage in space, ...
    
    Variation Handling    
        Tolerate tolerale variables (no frequent false alarms)
        Compensate tolerable variations by robot behavior adaption
        Handle exceptions so as to satisfice
        
    Is learning the solution?
        Probably part of the solution, but..
            ...not great for close-loop control
            ...bulky labeled data unavailable
            ...safety requires some degree of verifiability (proof by construction) (how do you verify a neural network?)
    
    Plan-based Robot Control is a better solution
        "The plan is that part of the robot control program, which the robot reasons about explicitly" (D. McDermott, 1992)
        Goal-directed action under uncertain/incomplete knowledge
        Modeling & optimizing & verifying robot action
        Compact communication of robot goals & actions on a high abstraction level (not, "well you gave me 5 tons of data and I learned it)
        Explicit treatment of uncertainty & exception
        Hierarchical organization (layers of meaning and definition)
    
    CHIMP Plan Execution Model
        Flexible timeline representation
        NOW pointer
        Keep hierarchical task structure
        Integrate plan generation & execution
