Neuroergonomics as cognitive neuroscience in realistic settings
    > Use realistic settings for applied and basic cognitive neuroscience
    > Theoretical concepts in cognitive psychology and underlying brain processes are multidimensional and overlapping (theory developed in lab -- map to real world?)
    > Predicting cognitive variables of interest continuously and time resolved using multivariate data driven methods (real time)
    > Combine neurophysiological statistical models with functional modeling (e.g. cognitive architecture) to instantiate quantitative models (hypotheses)

fNIRS = Near-InfaRed-Spectroscapy
    
fMRI indirectly measures brain activity by measuring blood flow fNIR is functionally equivalent to the fMRI, it simply uses a different sensor.

One question is, do neuroscience theories accurately predict real world cognitive functioning measured by fNIRS here. 
    > For the n-back problem the most active part of the brain is what neuroscience theory would predict (memory attention)
    > For lateral contol demands the neuroscience theory doesn't seem to explain measured cognitive demand (spatial attention)
    
Can we accurately predict brain load from previously observed and labeled tasks? This suggests spacial and memory attention can't be considered independently.
    > in 0-back lateral control problems only a 43% prediction accuracy
    > in 1-back lateral control problems only a 80% prediction accuracy
    > in 2-back lateral control problems only a 85% prediction accuracy
    > in 3-back lateral control problems only a 70% prediction accuracy
    > in 4-back lateral control problems only a 63% prediction accuracy
    
How many of neuroscience theories can be considered indepenendently vs dependently ? Do we need a new model for every combination of neuroscience theories?
    
What could the cognitive model look like? Presenter does not a strong feeling either way.
    > Probabilistic model?
    > Rule based model?
    
Are they creating behavioral models based on their cognitive prediction? Or simply trying to predict human cognitive capabilities.

A comment on the modeling question raised by the n-back task. The n-back task fits well into parametric models (we simply increase the parameter in our model). An n-back task may not fit as well into a rule based model. A rule based model may require a new rule for every "n" in the n-back task.
