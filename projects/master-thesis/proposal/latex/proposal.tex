%Understanding human behavior is key to social success but not accessible to computers
%Often times identical behaviors can be performed by people with very different intents and motives
%There is growing recognition in healthcare fields that behavior is a better predictor of outcomes than traditional biomarkers like genes, bmi or labs
%Human's naturally think in narratives of which intent and goals are a critical component

%Narrative is increasingly seen as important to many fields including:
%	Ethics (Narrative Ethics)
%	Politics (Meta-Narratives)
%	Theology (Meta-Narratives, Narrative Theology)
%	Therapy (Narrative Therapy)

%A long history of psychological research suggests that simple, learned behaviors come about through a process known as reinforcement learning (Not the right psychology name. E.g., Pavlov's dogs.)
%Building upon the hypothesis that even the most complex human developed from the rudimentary process of reinforcement learning, I will study what these motivators/rewards are

%Seeks to show that the describing behaviors according to rewards is meaningful even if it can't be shown to be "true"
%Seeks to show that there are certain key features that are most important to understanding human motivation?
