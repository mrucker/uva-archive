What Do We Want To Do With Reward???
	Colaborate!!!

predict (recommend) -- intervene (modify) -- classify (understand) -- ***collaborate (support)***

Policy = dynamics * rewards
 
Reward
  - Sparse (values, ends not means, structure) -- Some work suggests IRL learns policy better in this case
  - Dense  (desire, means and ends, agency) -- Some work suggests IRL learns rewards better in this case
  
If we had a reward without transition probabilities what would that tell us?

Social Cognitive Theory
Rational Choice Theory

Can we design a causal experiment to show a link between IRL rewards and behavior?

Behavioral Policy
	> True Dynamics, True Rewards
	> Believed Dynamics, Believed Rewards

How would this kind of modeling improve over things like...
	... learning reward and classifying on that substantially different from learning policy and classifying on that?
	... determining the change in distribution of a random variable based on a predictor (e.g., hours spent studying to grades instead of reward to grades)?
	... something about decision support systems?
