Adaptive Dynamic Network Architectures for Companion Systems (Position Paper)
C. Jarvers, H. Neumann
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Introduction
        Neuron in the brain uses a lot more information than a simple feed forward neural network
        We need to match neural networks more to the brain in order to advance our hardware
        A challenge with neural networks is stability. How do we learn from new examples without unlearning old examples?

Dialogues with IoT Companions Enabling Human Interaction with Intelligent Service Items (Position Paper)
K. Jokinen, S. Nishimura, K. Fukuda, T. Nishimura
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Introduction    
        HMI is qualitatively different with robots than screens: they are agents not tools
        Gathering and modelling of the knowledge related to actions that underlie human activities
        Is AI ready for social problems? Lots of position papers about how AI could be used. Fewer actual human-AI applications.
        Complex rule based intelligence suggested. Again, it simply seems the more complex the more likely we are to miss something important.
        AI as boundary crossing agents? Something about that phrase really resonates with me but does it mean anything? Why do I like it so much?
        Lots of ideas seen over and over again. It feels so tempting to build things up from nothing: add complexity until you get what you want.

Possible Applications of Companion Systems in Psychotherapy â€“ Perspectives on a New Technology (Position Paper)
S. Walter, A. Oschlies-Strobel, M. Hasse, H. Traue, K. Limbrecht-Ecklundt, L. Jerg-Bretzke
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Introduction
        Lots of ideas under the umbrella of companion technology
        
    Companion Technology Characteristics
        Emotion Recogition
        Environment/Situation Recogition
        Communication
        Decision, Conclusion and Planning
        
    Existing Applications
        There is no context where you couldn't create a companion technology
        
    How Do We Go From Assistant Technology to Companion-Technology?
