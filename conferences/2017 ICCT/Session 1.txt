    Introduction
        Quantitative Workload -- too much
        Qualitative Workload -- too hard

        Workload can't be measured directly so we measure stress as a correlated measure

        A Survey of Affective Computing for Stress Detection (Greene 2016)

    Data
        UUlmMACdatabase 
            > 60 participants
            > 45 minute sessions
            > multiple episodes in each session of sequences that try to create certain workload (too much, too little, hard, easy, etc.)
            > many measurements directly from the body (biopotential sensors. E.g., respiration, muscle activation, heart rate, temperature)
            > video recording from multiple angles
            > audio recording
            
        Another reference to the "Wizard of Oz" experiment setup. What is this? It seems important to this field.

        Valance, Arousal, Dominance dimensions used to measure affect (I think dominance is a measure of emotional control)
        
        Not yet publicly available but perhaps releasing to general public in the next year

    Analysis
        Trained a classifier using KNN, LDA and Random Forest -- validated using 10-fold and Leave one out

    Future Work
        How generalizable are these classifiers? Can they work in situ (out of the lab)?
        Which biopotential sensors are most helpful for classifying workload?

Pupil-Assisted Target Selection (PATS): State of the Art and Future Prospects
C. Strauch, J. Ehlers, A. Huckauf
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Introduction
        Gaze  -- provides a lot of information about attention
        Pupil -- pupil size can tell a lot about underlying cognitive functions
    
    Research Questions
        > how to measure pupil information?
        > how reliable is pupil information?
        > can a person actively control pupil size (can I intentionally change my pupil size?)
        
    Stimulus driven pupil-based selection
        > by making visual interfaces lighter and darker we can tell where somebody is looking based on their pupil size
        > on interfaces with multiple light and dark features the gaze will stay fixed while the pupil size will change with attendance
        
    Bio-feedback design
        > first established baseline mean and standard deviation for each participant's pupil size
        > with feedback participants can learn to change size of pupil outside of standard deviation
        
    Target Selection
        > selecting a visual target by actively increasing pupil size is slow. Intentional pupil size change takes several seconds.
        > traditional target selection by gaze alone is a little faster though more error prone.
        > pupil selection allows eyes to wander without worrying about sending incorrect intent.
        
    Summary
                        |   pro       |  con 
        ================|=============|========
        Stimulus-driven |   reliable  |  slow
        Active          |             |  slow
        Automatic       |   fast      |  small

Requirements for a Companion System to Support Identifying Irrelevancy (Position Paper)
M. Siebers, K. Göbel, C. Niessen, U. Schmid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Introduction
        Assist the user in temporally ignoring and permanent deletion of irrelevant digital objects
        Current research is focused on computer files in an administration setting and digital measurements in an industrial setting
        Relevancy can depend on domain, task, user
    
    Proposed Solution
        Irrelevancy probability (decision under uncertainty)
        Gain/maintain user trust (deleting is scary)
        Different actions per user (e.g., some users want assistant to have full autonomy, some users want a system to make suggestions to them)
    
    Conclusion
        Dare2Del as general framework
        Lots of work in NLP and tutoring for how to generate explanations from rules

Embedding of the Personalized Sentiment Engine PERSEUS in an Artificial Companion (Position Paper)
S. Guo, C. Schommer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    PERSEUS -- an open source framework for sentiment analysis
        > underlying algorithm is a 3 layer recurrent neural network
        > works on cross-document sentiment analysis (vs within document sentiment analsysis)
        
    Can we measure and determine a relationship between sentiment and emotion? Map sentiment onto the arousal-valence space?
