    Introduction
        Current top priority is water planet exploration (could we build a mars rover for Europa?)
        Two ideas for robots in space exploration
            Robot only (e.g., mars rover)
            Robot companions (maybe separate, maybe an exo-skeloton because current space suits are difficult to move in).
        Solar power per square meter decreases by the square of the distance from the sun. Important consideration for solar powered robots.
        Robot navigation is very challenging in zero-gravity environments. How do you train a robot to move in both zero-gravity and gravity environments?
        
    Communication
        H -> IM (Intelligent Machine) 
        IM -> H
        
        Intentional, direct
            Spoken Words
            Body Gestures
            Biosuit/Biosleeve
            Written Words
            EEG (this technique can actually be improved futher with EEG from two users)
            
        Subliminal, indirect
            Biometrics, who is the person
            Activity recognition
            Activity prediction/planning
