Introduction
    Prosidy -- pitch and phrase accents (e.g., raising pitch in english in order to ask a question)
    Entrainment -- "The Chameleon Effect". Non-conscious mimicry of the postures, mannerisms, facial expressions, and other behaviors
    Perception-behavior link -- Underlying cause
    Entrainment can happen and has been shown across lots of different behaviors

Subjects Who Entrain
    Perceived as more socially attractive
    Perceived as more competent
    Perceives conversation as more intimate
    
Computational Linguistics
    Read speech is very different from spontaneous speech (for this reason spontaneous speech is needed for research)
    "Given New" in a conversation is the study of when does introduced information become a "given" instead of "new"
    
Units of Analysis
    Inter-Pausal Unit (IPU): pause-free segment of speech > 50ms
    Turn: Sequence of speech from one speek without intervening speech from the other speaker
    Session: Complete interaction between two sujects on one task
    
Features With Units of Analysis
    Intensity mean
    Intensity max
    Intensity min
    Speaking rate
    
Forms of Entrainment
    Proximity -- significant similarity of partner features
    Convergence -- partner features become more similar over the course of a unit of analysis
    Synchrony -- positive correlation between partners
    
Ground Truth
    Partner Similarity     = How do I talk relative to my partner
    Non-Partner Similarity = How do I talk relative to people I didn't interact with
    Self Similarity        = How do I talk normally (monologue)
    
Experiment Of Collaborative Games
    They were able to find entrainment locally and globally within their games (in English and Mandarin)
    Among experiment participants, participants who showed high levels of entrainment scored higher
    Brought in outside people (mechanical turk) and asked them a set of sujective questions about the game interactions
    
Computation Linguistics Measure of Prosodic Similarity
    Perplexity of language models
    Levenshtein Distance
    KL Divergence
    
Experiment With Entraining Avatars
    People trusted the speaking avatars which entrained
    People thought the non-entraining speaking avatar was strange
