After coming up with a theory my job as a scientist is to seek to falsify my claim not validate it

Create intentionally built environs to get at what we are interested in

Cause = INUS (Insufficient but Non-redudant part of an Unecessary but Sufficient condition) (e.g. cigarette butt causing forest fire)

A cause is not deterministic but only increases the probability that an effect will occur

There are mannipulable and nonm-manipulable causes

As we develop new technology does the set of manipulable causes grow?

counterfactual
    > If  A then ?
    > If !A then ?
    
Manipulable and nonmanipulable is both simply something we don't yet have the technology to do and also 

If A Causes B Then
    > A came before B (The cause preceded the effect)
    > A correlates with B reliably (The cause was related to the effect)
    > Condition A and B are actually both caused by a third condition C (Can't find plausible alternative explanation)
    
There is a difference between a causal description (A causes B) and a causal explanation (A causes B because ...)

Types of generalizations = 

Extrapolation: Generalizing to a UTOS (units, treatments, observations and settings) not directly observed
Representation: generalizing to the domain about which a question is asked

ontological vs epistimological assumptions?

External Validity -- how much does my experiment match up with the environment I wish to study?
Construct Validity -- how much does my experiment measure what I wish to study?
