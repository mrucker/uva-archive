AMA = Autonomous Moral Agents
Theory of Mind and Mindreading (Bello 2013)
	
Programming Machine Ethics (Pereira 2016)
	> Moral Facets Amenable to Logic Programming
		> Doctrine of Double Effect
		> Dual-Process Model
		> Counterfactual Thinking
	> Individually Permissible Actions
		> Abduction
		> Modal Logic (necessary)
		> Deontic Logic (duties)
		> Utilitarianism
		> Prima Facie
	> Cognitive Abilities that Encourage Cooperative Behavior
		> Intention Recognition
		> Forgiveness
		> Revenge
		> Apology
		> Commitment

Moral choices for an AMA that can only share information?
	> Misrepresent
	> Deceive
	> Leak
	> Keep a secret

How to test moral decision making
	> Not Moral Turing Test? (Arnold 2016)

Are the morals required of Autonomous Agents dependent on the actions they can take?
	
Necessary Capabilities
	> Awareness of the consequences of its actions (Allen 2000)
	> Guilt (Arkin 2012)
	> Deception (Arkin 2012)
	> Dignity (Arkin 2012)

Human values are fragile and narrow (Soares 2015)
	
Aware of the consequences (this is separate from "caring" about the consequences)

Utilitarianism -- Ends justifies means
Virtues        -- 
Deontology     -- Should or shouldn't
Cooperation    -- 
Association    -- Supervised Learning
Emotions       -- 

AMA in small action spaces

If our agents have substantially different action spaces than humans can they have moral reasoning?
	Ethics of traffic light?
	Ethics of web server?

Make something and test something

Why don't we think of traffic lights as moral agents?

Which autonomous agents need morals and which don't?

Three paths
	> Evolve Cooperation using east asian ethics?
	> Develop a theory of ethics based on intent?
	> Study ethics within much small action spaces?
