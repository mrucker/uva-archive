Positive Statement  - Statement of fact/observation
Normative Statement - Statement of what should be or what is desireable

Game Theory     - Research of optimal decisions when there are multiple agents
Decision Theory - Research of optimal decisions when there is only one agent

Both Game Theory and Decision Theory have positivist and normative branches of research.

Two broad interpretations of probability: (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_interpretations)
	1. Physical probabilities (aka objecive or frequency probabilities)
	2. Evidential probabilities (aka bayseian probabilities)

In P(H|E) = P(E|H)*P(H)/P(E)
	P(H|E) is the posterior probability
	P(E|H) is the likelihood function
	P(H)   is the prior probability

Likelihood function can be written as L(H|E) and is equal to P(E|H)	

Bayesian Inference uses Bayes' Theorem to update the probability for a hypothesis as new evidence becomes available.

Entropy - Has different meanings in Statistical Mechanics, Thermodynamics and Information theory
	> Information Theory    -- a measure of how "unkown" a piece of information is. The more we know about a piece of information the less information is transfered when the information is revealed or observed.
	> Thermodynamics        -- How accessible a system's potential energy is to being transformed into mechanical energy.
	> Statistical Mechanics -- 
	
Random Variable -- an unknown quantity. Even though it is unkown we can come to know certain statistics that can describe its potential values.
