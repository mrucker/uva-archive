Use CHS to measure existing characteristics in a system
Use CHS to sustain existing characteristics in a system
Use CHS to convert existing characteristics in a system
Use CHS to construct new characteristics in a system

Apply CHS knowledge for some purpose
Discover CHS knowledge that can be used for some purpose

Define five characteristics in Cyber-Human interactions and then give mathematical arguments for how those characteristics impact groups of people (note a cyber component might measure differently in different cultures)
    > attention grabbing
    > understandable
    > motivating
    > sustaining
    
People learn naturally when exposed to new environments.
    
I'm not trying to solve a problem. I'm trying to create knowledge.

Do I want to create knowledge or solve a problem? 

A CHS can look drastically different from culture to culture (e.g. is Facebook a social network or news service? (http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/06/tech-and-other-peoples-problems/488297/))
    > as such can information about one CHS ever be generally applicable?

Some CHS are safety critical and as such the question isn't about what does the CHS do in a culture but how to get a CHS to work in a culture.
    > e.g., Traffic lights
    > e.g., Power Grids
    > e.g., Communication Networks
    
By creating a product or achieving some goal in a CHS system can I create general knowledge that can be applied elsewhere or just specific knowledge about the change/product I created?
    > Create knowledge about the process I went through as in a case study?
    > If I create a theoretical framework before I begin and follow it rigorously I can show that it works in one case
    
Is researching CHS fundamentally a anthropologist/sociologist problem? (http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/16/technology/intels-sharp-eyed-social-scientist.html)

Ethically, should ideas like codesign and participatory design be required when developing CHS? What if participation in the CHS is voluntary? What about when it isn't?

Are learning communities like Maker Spaces, Kahn Academy, StackOverflow and Wikipedia CHS?
